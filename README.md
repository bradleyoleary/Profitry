<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

MVP Features:

- Track income and expenses based off a variety of categories
- Integrated [Speechly](https://www.speechly.com), which enables the application to have a voice-enabled UI to input information.

- Responsive for both mobile and desktop devices

This was a fun little project to hone in on my frontend development skills using React and external libraries/frameworks. In the future, I hope to connect a backend with a database instead of using local storage.
